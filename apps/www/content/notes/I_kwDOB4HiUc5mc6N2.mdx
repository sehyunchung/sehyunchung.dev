Q: How important is routine when it comes to learning? For example, is it important to have a dedicated study area?

A: Not at all. Most people **do better** over time by **varying their study or practice locations.** The more environments in which you rehearse, the sharper and more lasting the memory of that material becomes—and less strongly linked to one “comfort zone.” That is, **knowledge becomes increasingly independent of surroundings the more changes you make—taking your laptop onto the porch, out to a café, on the plane.** The goal, after all, is to be able to perform well in any conditions.
Changing locations is not the only way to take advantage of the so-called context effect on learning, however. **Altering the time of day you study also helps**, as does **changing how you engage the material**, by reading or discussing, typing into a computer or writing by hand, reciting in front of a mirror or studying while listening to music: Each counts as a different learning “environment” in which you store the material in a different way.
