## `flex`
`flex-grow`, `flex-shrink`, + `flex-basis`의 shorthand이다.

## syntax
- **One-value syntax:**
   the value must be one of:
   - a `<number>`: In this case it is interpreted as `flex: <number> 1 0;` the `<flex-shrink>` value is assumed to be `1` and the `<flex-basis>` value is assumed to be `0`.
   - one of the keywords: `none`, `auto`, or `initial`.
- **Two-value syntax:**
   the first value must be a `<number>` and it is interpreted as `<flex-grow>`. The second value must be one of:
   - a `<number>`: then it is interpreted as `<flex-shrink>`.
   - a valid value for width: then it is interpreted as `<flex-basis>`.
- **Three-value syntax:**
   the values must be in the following order:
   - a `<number>` for `<flex-grow>`.
   - a `<number>` for `<flex-shrink>`.
   - a valid value for width for `<flex-basis>`.
